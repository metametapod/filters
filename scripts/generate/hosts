# I use the AdGuard DNS filter because it has minimal breakage and doesn't
# block crash reporting services. However, it's formatted for an ad blocker /
# DNS client, and some rules only provide a prefix which is unsupported in
# hosts file. As a workaround, this expands those prefixes against a stricter
# list while still preferring the original ruleset.
