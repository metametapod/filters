# DNS crash and error-reporting allowlist
#
# Compatible with AdAway and AdGuard Home.
#
# Ad blocking can cause unique app crashes, and these need to be reported to
# developers so they can fix it.
#
# This unblocks services strictly designed for crash, error, or performance
# reporting without invasive tracking.
#
# To use in AdAway, go to sources > Add source, select "Allow" as list type and
# add the URL. In AdGuard Home, add to Filters > DNS allowlists.
